I go on holiday soon and I want something similar to [typelit](https://www.typelit.io/typing-console/The_Wizard_of_Oz/0/23) that I don't need to be online for.

## TODO

- [x] Display text and write over it as the cursor moves along
- [x] Read text in from a file
- [x] Validate and colorise
- [ ] Menus and feature
- [ ] Scoring 
- [ ] Remember position
